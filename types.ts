// types.ts
// This file can be used to define shared TypeScript types and interfaces.
// For this project, specific types are co-located with components or are simple enough not to require global definition.

// Example:
// export interface User {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
